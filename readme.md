# 😂 Flask AI Meme Generator

Create instant memes using the power of AI! This Flask-based web app takes user-provided context and style and generates a meme image in seconds. Ideal for learning Flask's request processing, working with images, and integrating backend AI/machine learning models or APIs like OpenAI, Replicate, or Stable Diffusion.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Generate memes from user input (`context` + `style`)
- 💻 Simple interface using HTML + Flask
- 🖼 Returns a meme image and benchmarking info (`time_taken`)
- ⚙️ Modular design with a separate Python script (`generate_meme.py`)
- 📦 .env support for API keys and secrets

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Flask** – Lightweight backend with RESTful route handling
- **Jinja2** – Templating engine for rendering HTML
- **dotenv** – Manage environment variables securely
- **Custom `generate_meme_image()`** logic (e.g. using AI tools, OpenAI, etc.)

## 🖼 How It Works

1. User enters:
   - Meme **context** (e.g., funny idea or situation)
   - Meme **style** (e.g., sarcastic, wholesome, dark humor)

2. These values are POSTed to the `/generate` endpoint.

3. The server runs `generate_meme_image(context, style)` defined in `generate_meme.py`.

4. A meme is generated, saved inside `static/memes/`, and returned as JSON.

## ✅ Requirements

Make sure you have these installed:
- flask
- python-dotenv
- Any dependencies used in `generate_meme.py` (e.g. `Pillow`, `requests`, `openai`, etc.)

You can list them in a `requirements.txt`:
- flask
- python-dotenv

## 🚀 Deployment

This app runs locally but can be deployed to:
- Heroku ✅
- Render ✅
- Replit ✅
- Railway ✅
- or any other Python-friendly cloud hosting platform

Make sure to set environment variables correctly on the platform.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add user-uploaded images or templates
- Use pre-trained ML models (Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, OpenAI GPT for text-to-image)
- Meme filters or stickers
- User login and meme gallery
- Download/share buttons
